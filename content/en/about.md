<h2 class="mt-0"> What is the Baseline Protocol?</h2>

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020 and launched as an open source / open standards project, governed by the [OASIS Open](https://oasis-open.org) standards body under the [Ethereum OASIS Open Project]. From 29 June 2021 to 8 April 2024, the Ethereum OASIS Open Project was known as EEA Community Projects.

Baseline is a set of tools and libraries that enables enterprises to synchronize complex, multiparty, business processes with privacy and without putting any sensitive information on shared databases or any kind of blockchain.

Zero Knowledge circuits employ a common frame of reference that allows all parties in a networked business process to maintain their own systems-of-record in a verified state of consistency. Public blockchain is advised but not required.
