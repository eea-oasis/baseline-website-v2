Nick Kritikos, Baseline Protocol TSC member, will be giving a talk at [IoT World 2021](https://tmt.knect365.com/iot-world/) in Santa Clara to showcase the baseline protocol. The baseline protocol is a new standard coming out of [OASIS Open](https://www.oasis-open.org/) later this year for universal state synchronization under zero knowledge over the internet, and it promises to improve and increase the practice of secure multiparty coordination. The talk will take place on Thursday, November 4, 2021 1:55 PM to 2:15 PM.
