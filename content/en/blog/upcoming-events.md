NATC is the NASSCOM Annual Technology Conference, a global platform showcasing disruption by Digital Technologies.

As part of this year's event, Baseline Protocol TSC Chair, John Wolpert, will show how the companies that already know how to ‘BASELINE’ are winning seven and eight figure enterprise transformation projects with major brand names and how the end of 2021 will see the release of tools and services that will make baselining something every company will be asking for in 2022 and beyond. This talk will take place on Friday, 24 September. [Register now for this virtual conference!](https://nasscom.in/natc/#1)
