The Baseline Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for developing a technical roadmap for the year, managing the grant funds, handling code repository conflicts, and leading the Baseline Core Developers. The TSC meets regularly to assess the progress of the Baseline Protocol towards standard ratification, implementations, and enterprise adoption.
The TSC is elected once a year.

The latest elections took place throughout October 2022. On November 4, the election results were finalized and presented at the [November Baseline General Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3oRU-kWJM&t=1761s). 
See the new TSC members [here](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline/blob/main/TECHNICAL-STEERING-COMMITTEE.md).
