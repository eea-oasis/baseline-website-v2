**2023 Roadmap for the Baseline Protocol Released!**

The [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline/blob/main/TECHNICAL-STEERING-COMMITTEE.md) has released the[ 2023 Roadmap](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline/blob/main/Baseline%20Protocol%20-%202023%20Roadmap%20v1.0%20.pdf) which outlines the high priorities for the advancement of the Baseline Protocol for the year. The breakdown of the roadmap is as follows:

\
**Technical**
1. Complete **Baseline Protocol Implementation 3 (BRI-3)**, which follows a simple and vendor-agnostic approach to enable the subsequent roadmap items, ([read more here](https://entethalliance.org/2023-01-25-new-baseline-protocol-reference-implementation-hits-milestone/)).
2. Conduct a **demonstration of interoperability** for Baseline Protocol Implementations (BPIs) for a simple use case to produce results of standard interoperability.
3. Develop an **SDK** of out-of-the-box tools for BRI-3 for developers to create a BPI.

\
**Outreach**
1. Conduct a **BPI roadshow** through a series of in-person and virtual events to demonstrate BPIs.
2. Host an **interoperability event** for BPI interop demonstration. 

\
**Standard**
1. Reach **final project specification** of the Baseline Protocol standard as an [OASIS standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards/).
