# The Baseline Standard Across Industries: The Case of Mobility

The digital business landscape is rapidly changing – generative AI, 3D printing, Zero-Knowledge, Autonomous Vehicles, IoT devices, peer-to-peer transactions, and rapidly changing regulatory compliance – and companies across industries are facing digital transformation at a speed never seen before. To make matters worse, the **[Digital Business Trilemma](https://itntrust.medium.com/the-digital-business-trilemma-zero-trust-and-the-itn-14d80b9599e8)** (only two of Decentralization, Security, and Performance can be achieved at the same time) puts companies in an additional quandary since decentralization increases exponentially – approx. [15 billion connected Things in 2022 (doubling every 3 years)](https://iot-analytics.com/number-connected-iot-devices/)  – and, therefore, the number of vulnerabilities of digital business activities also increases exponentially.

 

Given these powerful digital forcing functions and _the need to focus on expanding digital revenue securely and in a compliant way,_ every enterprise must at least be able to:



1. Authenticate and authorize every other participant for every single digital business interaction at all times,
2. Prove and verify the authenticity, integrity, and correctness of every digital service transaction, and its associated supply chain of prior digital transactions informing and triggering said digital service transaction,
3. Minimize the exchange of sensitive data in a digital service transaction, ideally to zero – [zero-knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof)

These three critical requirements can be formulated into a framework called _Multiparty Zero Trust under Zero Knowledge_ (MZTZK). **The first global MZTZK framework and standard is the [Baseline Protocol](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard)**.

When we zoom in on the mobility sector, we see that digital transformation is driven by several factors, including the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles with new supply chain regulations focused on sustainability and labor protections, shared mobility services, and the need for enhanced security and privacy measures.

To address these challenges, mobility companies are turning to frameworks and technologies such as the Baseline Protocol and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to create more efficient and secure systems and processes. The Baseline Protocol is an open-source initiative that uses blockchain and zero-knowledge technology to streamline multi-party business processes and create a common language for enterprise systems, where ZKPs are used to enable secure and private transactions without revealing sensitive information.

One of the most promising use cases of the Baseline Protocol and ZKPs in the mobility industry is in the area of supply chain management, in particular for electric batteries. With the rise of electric vehicles, there is a growing demand for the efficient and transparent tracking of batteries, from raw materials to finished products. By using the Baseline Protocol, companies can create a shared system for tracking the entire supply chain, with ZKPs ensuring the privacy of sensitive information. This can help ensure that the supply chain is efficient, sustainable, and free from fraud and corruption.

Another mobility area where the Baseline Protocol and ZKPs are useful is in the management of vehicle data. With the increasing number of connected vehicles, there is a need for secure and reliable systems for collecting and analyzing data. The Baseline Protocol can be used to create a common language for different systems to communicate with each other, while ZKPs can ensure that sensitive data, such as location and driver behavior, is kept private and secure.

In addition to supply chain management and data management, the Baseline Protocol and ZKPs can be applied in other areas of the mobility industry, such as:



* Mobility as a Service (MaaS): With the rise of shared mobility services, there is a need for a secure and efficient system for managing transactions between different providers. The Baseline Protocol can be used to create a shared system for managing transactions, while ZKPs can ensure that sensitive data, such as personal information and payment details, is kept private and secure.
* Autonomous Vehicles: As autonomous vehicles become more prevalent, there is a need for secure and reliable systems for communication between vehicles and infrastructure. The Baseline Protocol can be used to create a common processing framework for disparate systems to efficiently communicate with each other, with ZKPs ensuring that sensitive data, such as vehicle location and destination, is kept private and secure.
* Electric Vehicle Charging: With the increased adoption of electric vehicles, there is a need to securely and efficiently manage the charging infrastructures within and across provider networks. The Baseline Protocol can be used to create a shared network for managing charging infrastructure with Baseline Protocol ZKPs ensuring that sensitive customer and provider data, such as energy usage and payment details, are kept private and secure.
* Car Dealer Loan Management: To ensure that dealer vehicles with outstanding loans are correctly accounted for, large car lenders employ human auditors to perform what is called dealer floorplan auditing. This inefficient process results in higher vehicle prices for consumers. The [Citopia vinTRAK](https://dlt.mobi/citopia-vintrak/) pilot in collaboration with the ConsenSys Enterprise ZK Team, a significant Baseline Protocol contributor, as an application of MZTZK verifiably attests correct attributes of vehicles, such as their location or membership to a group of vehicles (i.e. a car dealer fleet). In tests, this has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the number of personnel required for an audit and significantly decrease financial and data compliance efforts eliminating substantial process costs.

Overall, the Baseline Protocol and ZKPs have the potential to revolutionize the mobility industry by creating more efficient, secure, and sustainable networks of systems. By creating a common framework and “language” for different systems to communicate with each other while ensuring the privacy of sensitive information, the Baseline Protocol and ZKPs can help mobility companies overcome the challenges of the forcing functions of digital transformation and meet the demands of an ever-changing industry.
