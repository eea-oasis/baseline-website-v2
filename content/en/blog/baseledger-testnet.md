The [Baseledger testnet](https://www.baseledger.net/testnet/) launched on Sept 1, 2021. The high-performance, high-availability network provides verified systems integration services at very low cost, without requiring companies to spend time and capital setting it up. Baseledger complies with the Baseline Protocol to ensure that no data is moved from companies’ systems of record onto any kind of blockchain, and proofs cannot be used by an observer to learn anything about companies’ confidential information, relationships or business activities. The network is secure, always-on, and anchored to the Ethereum blockchain using a cryptographic technique called ZK Rollups to prevent tampering with the proofs.
