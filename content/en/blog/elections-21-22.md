Nineteen Baseline participants have been nominated for the 2022 Baseline Technical Steering Committee. The vote to choose the next 11 members of the TSC will start at Noon US Eastern on Wednesday, October 13 and end at midnight of the final timezone on October 26, 2021. 

If you are not already an eligible voter, you can become one by making a pull request on one of the Baseline repositories and having it approved before the vote opens.

Your pull request need not be significant or meaty. Any minor tweak will do; the pull request is your statement of interest in joining in the work.

Once the voting starts, no more eligible voters can be added.

Make your pull request soon and then watch for the ballot announcement on https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/topics. (Subscribe to the list to receive updates on the project emailed directly to you.)
