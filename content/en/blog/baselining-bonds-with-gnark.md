---

Community members Boris Breslav (JP Morgan) and Luiz Soares (White Prompt) developed a significant contribution to the Baseline Protocol through their recently completed grant work.

Boris thoroughly explains the use case and value of this financial circuit in his article, ['Proving Request for Quotes (RFQ) of Bonds Under Zero Knowledge'](https://medium.com/@bearvb/proving-request-for-quotes-rfq-of-bonds-under-zero-knowledge-836f11e45683).

This work illustrates the clear need for multiparty coordination under zero knowledge that the Baseline Protocol provides, and the vast opportunities for application in the banking and finance spaces.
