The Baseline Protocol community is expanding by the week! A wide range of people are learning about and interested in contributing to the work being done across the community of students, researchers, developers, and professionals of various specialties. The Baseline Outreach team has just released a Community Member Starter Kit to give new members a seamless onboarding process, as the Baseline Protocol is often peoples first experience contributing to an open source project. The Starter Kit aims to address initial questions about the open source community, outline the different teams, and serve as a one stop shop of resources.
