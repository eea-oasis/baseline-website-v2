“We’re excited to have Envision join the Baseline community, alongside a growing list of global leaders that are sponsoring the Baseline Protocol. Envision’s sponsorship is especially important because baselining is all about security in multi-party processes, and highlights how important it is that we come together to help organizations reshape and build trust within vertical industries,” said John Wolpert, ConsenSys Group Executive and Baseline Protocol Technical Steering Committee Chair.

Launched in March of 2020, the Baseline Protocol uses advances in peer-to-peer messaging, zero-knowledge cryptography, and blockchain technology to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises without moving company data out of traditional systems of record.

“We are thrilled to have Envision join as a sponsor of the EEA Community Projects in support of the Baseline initiative. Envision will be collaborating with the hundreds of companies and thousands of individuals are already actively participating in the Baseline initiative because it enables private collaboration between companies without sensitive data going on-chain,” said Dan Burnett, EEA Executive Director and EEA Community Projects Governing Board Chair.
